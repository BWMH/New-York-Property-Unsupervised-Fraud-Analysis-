# New-York-Property-Unsupervised-Fraud-Analysis-
This project aimed to apply unsupervised techniques to identify potential tax fraud related to properties in NYC. I applied data cleaning such as imputation and feature engineering to improve data qualiy. I later created 45 expert variables and reduced dimensions via Z-scale and PCA. I further developed fraud model to identify properties that show abnormal characteristics and land values, which could indicate fraudulent activity. Looking at a list of the few hundred properties that the model gives a high score, further examination about tax fraud can be conducted.
